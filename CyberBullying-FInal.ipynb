    "Bullying has shifted from school recess encounters to the boundless frontiers of the digital world. Victims can be targeted whenever and wherever they are. Bullies on the other hand, can hide behind their computer screens and not have to confront their victims face-to-face: they can also hide behind false avatars and fake user names. \n",

    "The famous microblogging platform Twitter has become a daily essential by having over 330 million monthly active users tweeting 5,787 messages every second (source). However, each passing day the platform is becoming a bully playground as hurtful tweets target individuals, especially teens in their fragile growing years. It is estimated that around 15,000 bullying-related tweets are posted every day (source). Furthermore another research suggests (source)\n",
